# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Create a model by which Big Mart can analyze and predict the outlet production sales.
A perfect project to learn Data Analytics and apply Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XG Boost Regressor, Extra Tree Regressor, AdaBoost Regressor, Support Vector Regressor and KNN Regressor) to predict the outlet production sales.
